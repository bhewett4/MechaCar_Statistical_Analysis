# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

Using R to conduct a statystical study of car performance

## Overview of the Analaysis:

Our project consists of of three technical analysis deliverables as well as an a proposal. They are as follows: <br>

* Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG's
* Deliverable 2: Visualization of Summary Statistics of Suspension Coils
* Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
* Deliverable 4: Propose a Study Comparing MechaCar to Competitors

## Propose a Study Comparing MechaCar to Competitors

The intent of this study would be to compare MechaCar to competetitors to determine if they are reasonably priced vehicles. The different metrics that we are working with are:

* 2 or 4 Wheel Drive
* Fuel Type / Fuel Capacity
* Mileage Per Gallon

Our hypothesis is that MechaCar can outperform other vehicles in all of these metrics, and be at a more affordable price point. In order to determine this we would conduct multiple linear regression to determine correlation between vehicles and their price point against these metrics.
